# Stabilizing-Priors-for-Robust-Bayesian-Deep-Learning
## COMP6248 Deep Learning Reproducibility Challenge

This repository contains the codes and report for the reproducibility challenge of the paper - [Stabilizing Priors for Robust Bayesian Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10386) which was presented in Bayesian Deel Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2019.

The code for this challenge is based on [this original code](https://github.com/felixmcgregor/Bayesian-Neural-Networks-with-self-stabilising-priors/blob/master/BasicDemo.ipynb)

We have performed significant experimentation and analysis to replicate the results in a simple format.
